I am in integrative organismal biologist interested in questions about behavior, ecology, evolution, and physiology. I mainly work on wild birds, but I'm interested in questions that have broad applicability to understanding how animals deal with challenging situations and why some individuals are more successful than others. Although I work on wild animals, a large part of my work uses quantitative tools and lab techniques including epigenetics, diet metabarcoding, microbiome studies, and remote sensor networks. I'm currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Colby College and a Research Associate in the [Vitousek Lab](http://www.vitousek.weebly.com) at Cornell University.
